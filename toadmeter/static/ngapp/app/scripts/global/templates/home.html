    <p>Have you ever had a feeling "<em>here is something that I want and can afford, but still it is too expensive, so shouldnt buy it</em>"? In russian this feeling describes as "<em>to be strangled by a toad</em>". <strong>Toadmeter</strong> is a simple app that can help you to tame this evil toad by controlling your expenses.</p> 
        <p>Yes, there are plenty of such apps. I don't pretend this one to be the best or even good enough, it was developed mostly for experience and my own need to have <a ui-sref="secure.costs.stats">configurable visualization</a>.</p>
    
    <p>Toadmeter can log your incomes and expences (or import them from CSV generated by other apps) and show them as list or as configurable graphs.</p>

            To use toadmeter you have to register, but it is simple, just username and password.
